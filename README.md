Welcome to my portfolio of **Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Computer Vision** work — developed through university coursework, self-learning, and platforms like **DataCamp**. This space highlights my hands-on projects, model development pipelines, and key learning milestones as I move deeper into AI-driven engineering solutions.

## 📚 Learning Highlights

### 🧠 DataCamp: Introduction to Deep Learning with Keras
> Completed course focused on foundational neural network design using Keras and TensorFlow.

- Built basic **Sequential** models for classification  
- Implemented hidden layers, activation functions, and dropout  
- Trained models on digit datasets using `fit()`, `evaluate()`, and `predict()`  
- Learned to monitor **loss**, **accuracy**, and prevent overfitting  

📄 *Coursework included handwritten digit classification and tuning model hyperparameters*
